## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aatmaj28/FinRAG.git
cd FinRAG
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download NLTK resources:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

4. Set up your API keys:
Edit the code to include your API keys for Mistral AI and Google Gemini.

## 🏃‍♀️ Running the Application

Start the application with:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The application has three main components:
- **Home Page**: Navigation hub for accessing different features
- **RAG System**: Query the pre-processed financial knowledge base
- **Document Q&A**: Upload and analyze your own financial documents

## 🔧 Usage Guide

### RAG System

1. Select a company from the dropdown menu
2. Choose your preferred RAG implementation (Custom or LangChain)
3. Select the LLM provider (Mistral or Gemini)
4. Choose a cross-encoder model for reranking (Custom RAG only)
5. Enter your query or select from example queries
6. Review the response and explore retrieved contexts

### Document Q&A

1. Configure document processing options:
   - Select a text chunking strategy
   - Choose chunk size
   - Select embedding model
2. Upload your 10-K or financial PDF document
3. Enter the company name
4. Wait for processing to complete
5. Follow the same query process as the RAG System

## 📊 RAG System Architecture

The system uses a hybrid retrieval approach combining:

1. **Dense Retrieval (Semantic Search)**:
   - Sentence Transformer embeddings
   - FAISS vector similarity search

2. **Sparse Retrieval (Keyword Search)**:
   - BM25 algorithm for keyword matching

3. **Hybrid Ranking**:
   - Weighted combination of semantic and keyword scores
   - Maximum Marginal Relevance for diversity
   - Cross-encoder reranking for final result quality

4. **Response Generation**:
   - Top contexts sent to Mistral AI or Google Gemini API
   - Contextual response generation with 100-word target

## 🛠️ Advanced Customization

### Text Chunking Strategies

- **Semantic Chunking**: Preserves meaning with content relationships (recommended for complex documents)
- **Fixed-Length Chunking**: Simple uniform chunks without overlap (faster processing)
- **TF-IDF Based Chunking**: Content-aware chunking based on term importance (good for topically distinct sections)

### Embedding Models

- **General Purpose (all-mpnet-base-v2)**: Works well for most text analysis tasks
- **Financial Domain (FinBERT)**: Specialized for financial terminology and contexts

### Cross-Encoder Models

- **MiniLM-L-6**: Fastest option with good performance
- **ELECTRA-Base**: Good balance between speed and quality
- **RoBERTa-Base**: Highest quality but slower performance

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Processing large PDFs may require significant memory and CPU resources
- API rate limits apply to the Mistral AI and Google Gemini services
- Table extraction requires Java to be installed for optimal performance
- Yahoo Finance data may not be available for all companies or may be delayed

## 🔑 API Keys

This application requires API keys for:
- Mistral AI: Get from [Mistral AI platform](https://mistral.ai/)
- Google Gemini: Get from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)

## 🎯 Motivation

This project was developed to address the significant challenge organizations face when trying to quickly extract relevant information from large financial documents. Instead of manually sifting through hundreds of pages of 10-K reports, earnings calls, and financial statements, this tool enables users to find precise answers through natural language queries.

The system was created as part of the CS 6120: Natural Language Processing course, applying advanced NLP techniques to solve real-world information retrieval problems in the financial domain.
